The all-in-one game launcher perfect for managing your huge libraries of video games & applications (if you want to!).

## Changelog
### 1.0.0
> [!NOTE]
> Most features are missing. Add Locations and Images manually via the database. Location is a path. Game is where you add a game or path. Image is just an ID. Place the image named {id}.{extension} in data/images. After this, add the record. Image extension must be filled properly.
